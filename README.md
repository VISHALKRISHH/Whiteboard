## Setting up a real-time WebSocket connection in a React component for collaborative editing:
   In React, a WebSocket connection can be established using `socket.io-client`. 
   The setup:
   - First, import and initialize the socket in your React component.
   - Use the `useEffect` hook or the constructor (if using class components) to handle connection setup and cleanup.
   - The socket listens to specific events (like 'canvas-data') and triggers functions to update the UI in real-time. In the provided code, `this.socket = io.connect("http://localhost:5000")` establishes the connection and listens for incoming data using `this.socket.on("canvas-data", ...)` to handle incoming data and update the canvas.

## Implementing drawing functionality on an HTML5 canvas using React:
   - The canvas element in React can be accessed using `querySelector` or React refs. Use `getContext('2d')` to get the drawing context.
   - Capture mouse movements and clicks to track when the user is drawing. In your code, mouse events like `mousemove`, `mousedown`, and `mouseup` are used to control drawing.
   - Drawing is done by using the `ctx.lineTo()` and `ctx.stroke()` methods to draw on the canvas. This can be dynamically updated as the user draws.

## Synchronizing the state of the canvas across multiple users in real-time:
   - Use WebSocket to emit the current state of the canvas to the server and broadcast it to all connected users. In the code, `socket.emit("canvas-data", base64ImageData)` sends the canvas data to the server.
   - The server then uses `socket.broadcast.emit()` to send the data to all connected clients, who then draw the image using the `ctx.drawImage()` method. This allows all clients to view the same canvas updates in real-time.

## Handling and displaying the list of active users:
   - To display active users, maintain a list of connected users on the server using WebSocket events such as `connection` and `disconnect`. 
   - Emit this user list to the connected clients via a custom WebSocket event, for example, `socket.emit('active-users', userList)`.
   - On the client side, handle this event to display the list of active users in the UI.

## Ensuring scalability and performance**:
   - Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling**: Use a load balancer like NGINX to distribute WebSocket connections across multiple servers.
   - **Socket.IO Scaling**: Use Redis or another pub/sub system to manage state and broadcast messages across different instances of the app when scaling horizontally.
   - **Throttling Canvas Updates**: To reduce network load, throttle the frequency of canvas updates (like the timeout in your code) and only send significant changes.
   - **Data Compression**: Compress the canvas data before sending it across the WebSocket to minimize bandwidth usage.
   - **Efficient Data Transfer**: Rather than sending full canvas updates, send only the regions that have changed using smaller deltas, which will reduce data transmission.
